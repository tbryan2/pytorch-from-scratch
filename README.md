# Purpose
I have a very surface level understanding of machine learning / AI. 

Sure, I can use Tensorflow a bit and I can download models from Hugging Face, but could I build a PyTorch model from scratch and run it on multiple GPUs? No.

If you read through the tinygrad repo (https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad) or watch any of Geohot's Twitch streams (https://www.twitch.tv/georgehotz) you'll see that tinygrad is an extremely low-level neural network library. By being so low-level, and adding accelerators for different types of hardware, it can train and run models at blazing speed.

### As AI/ML and software engineering becomes more and more democratized, what will set a developer apart is the ability to build from as close to bare metal as possible.

This project is designed to get ahead of this curve before it's too late. __I'm going to learn tinygrad, and the underlying concepts associated with it, from the ground up as someone who with surface level AI / ML skills.__ I'll document my exploration of this library on YouTube and post the links below. Code and outside sources will be shared in this repo, along with my notes.
