# Purpose
I have a very surface level understanding of machine learning / AI. 

Sure, I can use Tensorflow a bit and I can download models from Hugging Face, but could I build a PyTorch model from scratch and run it on multiple GPUs? No.

### As AI/ML and software engineering becomes more and more democratized, what will set a developer apart is the ability to build from as close to bare metal as possible.

This project is designed to get ahead of this curve before it's too late. __I'm going to learn PyTorch, and the underlying concepts associated with it, from the ground up as someone who with surface level AI / ML skills.__ I'll document my exploration of this library on YouTube and post the links below. Code and outside sources will be shared in this repo, along with my notes.
